# Proposal

## Team Members

Zach Lamb, Zhongzhi Zhang, Callan Fisher and Bader Alshemaimri
## Ideation

These ideation questions are the same as before. Your answers should represent
the integration of creative ideas from every team member.

* What is the name of your app?

Drink Together

* What collaborative activity can people do together using your app?

People can collaboratively recommend, rate and share bars locations. They can invite their friends using the app without needing to call them. 
* What is the ideal number of concurrent users (must be at least 10 but no more than 40)?

15-20

* What skills do people need in order to do this activity?

They need to be familiar with using social websites because drink together is buit upon these. 

* Is this activity for fun or for something practical?

It is for fun surely, but it could be something practical when drinking with coworkers.
* How can a person see what everyone else is doing?

A person can see his/her friend's location on the map. He can also chat with him/her.
* How can a person see the most recent result of everyone's collaborative effort?

By adding a status under every profile indicating whether a person left a bar or not.
* What can an admin see (i.e., God's mode)?

An admin can see list of bars and users.

## Contributions

For each person on the team, jot down a list of ideas credited to that person.
It's okay to credit multiple people for the same idea. The rationale of this
section of the proposal is to demonstrate that everyone on the team contributes
useful ideas.

* Person 1
  * idea
  * idea
* Person 2
  * idea
  * idea
* Person 3
  * idea
  * idea
* Person 4
  * idea
  * idea

## Plan

A reasonable way to implement a functional prototype of your together app
is to build upon the service-matching app (i.e. uber). Discuss what additional
efforts may be required from your team to develop the together app.

* What existing components of the uber app your team can reuse?

(TODO: Answer)

* What new components and features your team may need to build?

(TODO: Answer)

* What new skills your team will still need to acquire?

(TODO: Answer)

## What's Next?

This is a preliminary proposal. Next week, your team will receive feedback and
will work on building a _mockup_ of this app. The week after that, your team
will start implementing the app.
